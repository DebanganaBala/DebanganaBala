# Hi there, I’m **Debangana Bala** 👋

**MSc Bioinformatics & Computational Genomics** | Passionate about bridging **biology** and **software engineering**

---

## About Me

- I have a background in biology and a strong drive to apply computational and coding skills to biological problems.
- My goal is to work in **cross-functional roles**, where I can combine data science, programming, and genomics to drive scientific discovery.
- I’m especially interested in:  
  - Genomic data analysis (e.g. RNA-Seq)  
  - Bioinformatics pipelines and tool development  
  - Machine learning for biological insights  
  - Integrating software engineering best practices with research workflows

---

## What I Do / What I’m Learning

- **Languages & Tools:**  
  - R, Python  
  - Bash / Shell scripting  
  - Git, GitHub  
  - (Possibly: next-gen sequencing tools, data-visualization libraries, ML frameworks)

- **Projects:**  
  - *Bulk-RNA-Seq-Data-Analysis*: A step-by-step pipeline to analyze RNA-Seq data using Bash and R.  
  - (You can list more projects here — what you’ve done, what you're most proud of)

---

## My Philosophy & Approach

- I believe software can significantly accelerate biological research — not just by automating, but by making data more meaningful and reproducible.
- I take a **collaborative, interdisciplinary** mindset: I love working with biologists, data scientists, and engineers.
- I follow good software practices (version control, modular code, documentation) even in research settings, because maintainability matters.

## Currently Exploring

- Building **robust bioinformatics pipelines** (e.g., reproducible workflows)  
- Applying **machine learning** to genomics problems (classification, clustering, prediction)  
- Deploying / sharing tools (e.g., via packages or web interfaces)  
- Contributing to **open-source bioinformatics** projects
